## Construction of dataset
## 
## This is the code used to create the unicorn dataset, 
## when you present this dataset as a genuine old timey dataset, it
## does not really work that well, with modern R code that produces the set.
## 
## So maybe it was handed down through a time vortex by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek the time-traveler?
## 
## This code is also cc-by-4.0. use remix and whatever you like.

### This took a lot of effort, but the trick is to make a function that

### do, it works for everything. The real trick is, as is often the case,
### make it work on a subset, than apply on the total.

### creating unicycles set
### unicycles numbers and total price should be related. 
### perhaps use some of the population as basis ?
### .70 percent can buy cycle but with wide margins because of outside
### influences? Average price, in dutch guilders. 
### A unicycle in 2016 is approx 90 euros.  rembrandt got approx 4000 scudi, 
### 3200 gulden (guilders). .. I will use 90 guilders a piece, it being artisinal
### and all.
