# Learning goals for students


a student should:

- read in the data from excel
- recognize that one file contains 2 tables
- realize that countrynames are slightly different in 1 file
- join the files together
- create 1 'long' tidy datafile (country, year, value1, value2, value3)

During analysis:

-  realize that some years are missing
- perhaps impute, reason for reasons of missingness (disease epidemic in
  Austria, others are missing at random)
- find some relation between unicycles and unicorns in the 17th century in
western Europe
